    "Guys welcome to Machine Learning Bootcamp conducted by ACM JUIT Student Chapter, This is a community developed materials by Team Bootcamp for general reading.\n",

    "> Feel free to use it for whatsoever you wish, make changes and distribute whereever you wish, just add credits before reproducing :)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why preprocessing ?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Real world data are generally Incomplete such as, lacking attribute values, lacking certain attributes of interest, or containing only aggregate data**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Noisy: containing errors or outliers\n",
    "- Inconsistent: containing discrepancies in codes or names\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tasks in data preprocessing:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data cleaning: fill in missing values, smooth noisy data, identify or remove outliers, and resolve inconsistencies.\n",
    "- Data integration: using multiple databases, data cubes, or files.\n",
    "- Data transformation: normalization and aggregation.\n",
    "- Data reduction: reducing the volume but producing the same or similar analytical results.\n",
    "- Data discretization: part of data reduction, replacing numerical attributes with nominal ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data cleaning\n",
    "\n",
    "- Fill in missing values (attribute or class value):\n",
    "       * Ignore the tuple: usually done when class label is missing.\n",
    "       * Use the attribute mean (or majority nominal value) to fill in the missing value.\n",
    "       * Use the attribute mean (or majority nominal value) for all samples belonging to the same class.\n",
    "       * Predict the missing value by using a learning algorithm\n",
    "- Identify outliers and smooth out noisy data:\n",
    "        * Binning\n",
    "            ** Sort the attribute values and partition them into bins (see \"Unsupervised discretization\" below);\n",
    "            ** Then smooth by bin means,  bin median, or  bin boundaries.\n",
    "        * Clustering: group values in clusters and then detect and remove outliers (automatic or manual)\n",
    "        * Regression: smooth by fitting the data into regression functions.\n",
    "- Correct inconsistent data: use domain knowledge or expert decision.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data transformation\n",
    "\n",
    "- Normalization:\n",
    "       * Scaling attribute values to fall within a specified range.\n",
    "       * Scaling by using mean and standard deviation\n",
    "- Aggregation: moving up in the concept hierarchy on numeric attributes.\n",
    "- Generalization: moving up in the concept hierarchy on nominal attributes.\n",
    "- Attribute construction: replacing or adding new attributes inferred by existing attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data reduction\n",
    "\n",
    "- Reducing the number of attributes\n",
    "        * Data cube aggregation: applying roll-up, slice or dice operations.\n",
    "        * Removing irrelevant attributes: attribute selection (filtering and wrapper methods), \n",
    "        * Principle component analysis (numeric attributes only)\n",
    "- Reducing the number of attribute values\n",
    "        * Binning (histograms): reducing the number of attributes by grouping them into intervals (bins).\n",
    "        * Clustering: grouping values in clusters.\n",
    "        * Aggregation or generalization\n",
    "- Reducing the number of tuples\n",
    "        * Sampling\n",
    "\n",
    "### Discretization and generating concept hierarchies\n",
    "\n",
    "- Unsupervised discretization -  class variable is not used.\n",
    "        * Equal-interval (equiwidth) binning: split the whole range of numbers in intervals with equal size.\n",
    "        * Equal-frequency (equidepth) binning: use intervals containing equal number of values.\n",
    "- Supervised discretization - uses the values of the class variable.\n",
    "        * Using class boundaries. Three steps:\n",
    "            Sort values.\n",
    "            Place breakpoints between values belonging to different classes.\n",
    "            If too many intervals, merge intervals with equal or similar class distributions.\n",
    "        * Entropy (information)-based discretization. Example:\n",
    "            \n",
    "- Generating concept hierarchies: recursively applying partitioning or discretization methods.\n",
